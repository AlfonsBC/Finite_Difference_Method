The finite difference approximations for derivatives are one of the simplest and of the oldest methods to solve differential equations. It was already known by Leonhard Euler, in one dimension of space and was probably extended to dimension two by C. Runge. The advent of finite difference techniques in numerical applications began in the early 1950's and their development was stimulated by emergence of computers that offered a convenient framework for dealing with complex problems of science and technology.
