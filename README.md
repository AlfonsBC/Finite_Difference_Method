# Finite Difference Method
In the words of _Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827)_
> Read Euler: he is our master in everything.

In the words of _Richard Courant (1888-1972)_
> Euler: The unsurpassed master of analytic invention.

Here it is some _description_ about the project that is about
## Some interesting facts about Finite Differences

## Problem to solve

## Numerical Method

## Project
In this reopsitory, you will find the solution and implementation of using a numerical method of 
Finite Differences that will help us to solve the Heat difussion problem with boundaries that are
Dirichlet type and Neumann type or even a mixed of those previous one.
